# Auto_Encoder
A simple encoder using tensorflow.
We took MNIST dataset to triain this network.
This is the simplest autoencoder with one input layer, one encoded layer and one decoded layer.
The encoded layer only have 32 nodes.
The results are good but some of the decoded images get faded and was difficult to recognize.
